# Timer for Websites That Steal Your Time

This project helps to control time was spent on sites. It requires special extension for Chrome browser.

# Installing

Install extension for Chrome browser [Custom JavaScript for websites](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija).

Open configuration of [cjs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija) browser extension on the site you want to controll. Click on the link "your own external scripts", add [index.js](https://github.com/samstudy/34_timemachine/blob/master/index.js). Don`t forget to press "enable cjs for this host" to enable custom JS.

After that you will observe on left side browser: 

*   The timer which set for 5 minutes
*   After 5 minutes each 30 sec you will get motivation alert

For faster development you can use JS code hosted on localhost. Simple web server can be used for that, run:

```bash

python3 -m http.server
```

Add path `http://localhost:8000/index.js` to [cjs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija) browser extension. Done.
